# vibra3200
 The Vibra3200, a DIY vibration generator powered by a microcontroller, is an excellent tool for studying the effects of different vibrations on animals, specifically insects. With its adjustable settings and the ability to reproduce vibrations within a frequency range of 0 to 500 Hz, you can conduct experiments to observe how varying vibrations impact insect behavior, movement, or even physiological responses.
