Creating a vibration generator using an ESP32 and the components you mentioned is a great project idea. The ESP32 can be programmed using the Arduino IDE, so let's go step by step to build the project and provide you with a sample code to get started.

Step 1: Wiring the Components
First, wire up the components as follows:

Connect the VCC pin of the vibration motor module to the 5V pin of the ESP32.

Connect the GND pin of the vibration motor module to the GND pin of the ESP32.

Connect the IN pin of the vibration motor module to a digital pin of the ESP32 (let's say GPIO 14).

Connect the CLK pin of the rotary encoder module to GPIO 16.

Connect the DT pin of the rotary encoder module to GPIO 17.

Connect the SW pin of the rotary encoder module to GPIO 18.

Connect the + pin of the rotary encoder module to the 5V pin of the ESP32.

Connect the GND pin of the rotary encoder module to the GND pin of the ESP32.

Connect the SDA pin of the LCD display module to GPIO 21.

Connect the SCL pin of the LCD display module to GPIO 22.

Step 2: Install Required Libraries
You will need to install the "Wire" library and the "LiquidCrystal_I2C" library for the LCD display. To install the libraries, open the Arduino IDE, go to "Sketch" > "Include Library" > "Manage Libraries" and search for the libraries there.

Step 3: Writing the Code
Below is a sample code that combines the vibration motor control and LCD display. The rotary encoder is used to adjust the frequency of the vibration.
